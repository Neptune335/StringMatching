MY JOURNEY
23050111029 Medine Merve MARAL

To be honest, I didn’t do my best in this homework but I really put a big effort on it. Nothing has been going right for the past few days (all this year is the worst I think…) I have some problems with my family and my health. Even my back hurts so much while I’m writing this. Also there is not enough time because there are a lot of things I must do in a limited time but I’m really exhausted.

In this homework:
	I learned the bad character rule very well.
I can’t understand the good suffix rule completely, no problem with the logic but it’s terribly hard to implement it for me. I continue to think and study about it.
I have no creative ideas for pre-analysis and goCrazy parts. I can’t even imagine. It makes me feel bad.

On the other hand, this homework is one of the best homeworks I have ever seen. I appreciate that you care about the quality of the research and that you requested this journey report. Perfect quality. I wish I could do this properly but I feel like my brain is just frozen.

Thank you so much for everything.
